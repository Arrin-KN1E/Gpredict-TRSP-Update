# A Basic Gpredict .trsp Update
These are basic updates to the Gpredict ".trsp" files, which are the satellite transponder data files.
The updates address annoyances such as inconsistente naming, important selection location in drop-down list, missing transponder files for satellites, etc.  

The NOAA-HRPT folder is for HRPT to be the first selection in "Radio Control" for NOAA-15, NOAA-18, and NOAA-19 for those that work with HRPT more often than APT.  

General information about this project is after the satellites list.  
  
  
  
## Satellites to File Name List:  
#### Names are the satellites NORAD ID with '.trsp' (e.g. NOAA 15 is "25338.trsp").  
#### '~' denotes transponder file was created for that satellite.

## Where to put the files? 
These files are okay to use as drop and replace type files. This example is for Windows as I'm not sure about other systems.  

Go to *C:\Users\ (YourUsername) \Gpredict\trsp*  
(As always, have a backup of this folder in case something were to go wrong.)  

After downloading and choosing what files you want to use, drop the files in the 'trsp' folder to replace the old ones and confirm the overwrite and your done!


### General Information about this Project
This is a simple update of the transponder files that Gpredict uses. These are fixes of some of the issues seen when using "Radio Control" in Gpredict.  
This repo is the perfect way for making suggested file improvements and for new files to be added to the list.
